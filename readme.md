#Rocket League Tournament Manager

A project for an easy to use web application to organise and take part in tournaments for the game Rocket League by [Psyonix](http://psyonix.com/). This project was sparked by an idea of mine, which i already pitched in the [curi0s forum](https://forum.curi0s.de/) [HERE](https://forum.curi0s.de/index.php?thread/305-webapp-f%C3%BCr-turniere-rl-tournamentmaker/) (german forum). Hopefully updates will follow soon.
